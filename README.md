# IncidenceReporting

Reporting and Visualization for Hazardous Events

## Problem Statement
Create a solution that spreads awareness of, visualizes the importance of, and/or decreases the time-to-action of safety-related incidents or topics.

Example safety-related incidents: 1) Identification and reporting of tripping hazards 2) Personnel near heavy machinery 3) Escape of toxic gases

## Solution
Video data is collected to detect if someone has fallen, or if personnel are too near heavy machinery, or if another safety-related incident has happened. If a someone is too near heavy machinery, a notification will be sent out to them. Additionally, we have a webpage to visualize safety incidents geographically and topically, and we also have a place for people to write anonymous incidence reports.
